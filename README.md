# Sound-of-a-Pandemic
Sound making system based on COVID-19 data

A prototype sketch of a system that takes daily COVID-19 global infection data and converts it into sound. Each country is assigned a recording of a prayer uploaded to the internet about the virus. Each reported case is represented by the playback of a snippet of that prayer.

The main file is called _main.pd.

This uses a granular synthesis system, and it used the Purest JSON external for accessing the data.

It crashes a lot when trying to get the data. I don't know why. 

Also, the patch is extremely messy. Good luck figuring it out! Let me know if you have questions. find me here:
