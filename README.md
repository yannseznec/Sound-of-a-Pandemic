# deathIncrease
Sound making system based on COVID-19 data

An instrument/installation that plays a number of fragments of prayer requests about COVID-19 that people have uploaded to YouTube. The number of fragments is the number of people who died the previous day in America (in the database I am using this is called the 'deathIncrease').

It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, with a Teensy LC microcontroller for the control inputs. 

The main file is called _main.pd. 

This uses a granular synthesis system, and it used the Purest JSON external for accessing the data. There are a lot of vestigial things in this repo from previous versions...have fun going through my past poor decisions.
